      "We started moving westbound again, still about two hours out from the safehouse. The road was quiet, the only noise was the overactive police scanner and the odd freightliner passing by. Alfred had fallen asleep in his chair, but the sensors were hardwired into the front dash of the van. If anyone decided to attack, at least I would know about it. It was odd, for $100 million I had figured that enemies would be crawling out of the woodworks, but so far only two small groups of mercenaries. This was still the first night, and it was only just beginning. We drove for an hour and a half before an alert blared across the screen of the computer. “Sir, it appears you have a message.” Alfred said as he half lazily glared through his glasses. \n",
      "\n",
      "“From who?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“It appears to be encrypted. It reads ‘I know where you’re going, but don’t let it stop you, I will see you soon enough.’ Rather boring. . .” He trailed off as if he had more to say. \n",
      "\n",
      "“What is it Alfred?” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Well sir, the encryption styling seems familiar, do you remember that Slade Wilson fellow? Oh, he had that silly name. You took his right eye when you last fought.” \n",
      "\n",
      "“Deathstroke.” I had figured he had heard about the bounty. Slade Wilson was one of the best assassins on the planet, we had crossed paths before. He tried to take out a target I had been tracking for a month, instead, I took his eye. No doubt he would be coming. He was smart, calculated. Trained in most martial arts and injected with a form of ‘super soldier’ serum that made him damn near unstoppable. But every man has a weakness, you just have to find it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "“Another thing sir, the radar appears to be jammed. If anyone decides to attack now, we best be prepared. You won’t be able to see it coming this time.” He slid back away from the computer and began loading the mounted turret at the back of the van. It may have been that Deathstroke sent those mercenaries. He had enough money and power to do so, I just figured he would have used some more formidable than the ones I left on the side of the road. Nonetheless, I had to be extra careful now. As strong as I am, Deathstroke was stronger. I know I can beat him hand to hand, but he was a military tactician at one point, and he knows how to play his cards. \n",

      " Then out of nowhere an explosion rang out from underneath the car and we were sent down over the edge of the road. The van landed hard on its side. I looked behind to see Alfred unconscious, he was hurt but would most likely survive, I kicked out the sunroof and put my back to the van. Four sets of tires screeched to a halt overhead. Out in front of me was a large cornfield, tall enough to cover myself and plan my next move.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I left Alfred behind and made way for the cover, it was me they wanted after all, he wasn’t the one with $100 million on his head. I laid traps behind me as I ran in between the corn. Small explosives, pressure plated gas cannisters, and a couple spike lines that would fill a man from foot to mouth with two thousand needles. All things I have used before in my many years, all very effective. I found a spot lower in the ground than the rest of the field and waited for my prey. I switched to thermal imaging lenses and made a headcount. Sixteen enemies lay before me, everyone moved passed the van. Not one disturbing Alfred where he lay.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In an instant, three explosions sent men flying in all directions. The sound of gas hissing from a cannister filled the corn. I threw my mask on, a breath of that gas would knock a man out, anymore and you were as good as dead. The sound of spikes rippled through the air and two men fell down screaming before going silent. My thermal imaging counted five remaining. They grouped together and pushed through towards where I was hidden. I threw six smoke pellets from my belt in a circle all around them. Disoriented they began to back towards each other. Easy targets. Three of my batarangs found their way to the enemy's heads. The last three men charged, thinking they had my location. They did not. I dashed behind them and grabbed one from the back of his head, my glove muffling his voice as I dragged him into darkness. The snap of his neck alerted the last two. They began firing blindly where the noise had originated, their bullets riddle the corpse of the dead comrade. I came behind again and smashed their heads together. More bodies to fertilize the crops.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the sound of a blowpipe whistled through the air, I turned in the direction of the sound, but it was too late. The dart whizzed into the side of my neck, as I faded out of consciousness, a lady stood down looking at me from the road. She was green from the toes up, other than her hair, fiery auburn, burning in the moonlight. “Ivy. . .” I managed as my body slumped to the ground. And then, darkness. \n",

      "“Take the hood off him, the world's greatest assassin deserves that much respect.” A man in a full battle suit walked towards me, half black and half orange. He removed his mask to reveal grey-white hair clean cut, overtop of an old face, with one blue eye and one covered with a black patch. A scar ran down from brow to jaw. “Deathstroke” I muttered as I woke. \n",

It made me so mad. I don't wear a mask necessarily for myself but because I know it can protect others and many service workers are rightfully scared of their exposure levels.\n",
